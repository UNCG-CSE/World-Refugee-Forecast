<h3><b> Nathaniel Arnold | Ashley Overman | Rishi Khanna | Basheer Eljabaly</b></h3>

<h2><b>Goal</b></h2>
<p>The intent of this project is to observe correlations between refugee patterns, agricultural yields (including GDP), happiness index, and food deficits to predict whether or not individuals are leaving countries due to famine or failure to produce crops to sustain the population. These correlations will help us to forecast where a large influx of refugees are likely to move to in the future.</p>

<h2><b>What are refugees?</b></h2>
<p>Refugees, according to the online dictionary, are individuals who have been forced to leave their country in order to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster. This project will focus on famine, which can be caused by a conflict within a country or a natural disaster. Refugees also have a variety of countries within the world to choose where to seek asylum. This project analyzes this data, that has been cleaned and visualized, in order to predict where these individuals may seek asylum in the future.</p>
