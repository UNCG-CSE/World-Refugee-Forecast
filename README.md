# World-Refugee-Forecast
This project will take into account several data sets and variables. The intent of this project is to observe correlations between climate change, refugee patterns, and agricultural yield in order to predict whether or not individuals are leaving countries due to famine or failure to produce crops to sustain the population. The common variable amongst the three data sets we will analyze is by country, however we must be mindful and ensure that the data is normalized. This will reduce the chance of skewed data from outliers (small countries with very small numbers of refugees). Refugee patterns as well as other variables such as inflation and current population can be used for further analysis. Weather data such as rainfall amounts, heat, drought, etc. can also be used to determine crop yield by a particular size of land.
