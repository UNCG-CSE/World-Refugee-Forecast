### Goals: 
 - Define Refugee: a person displaced from thier home of origion due to emergency or life threatening circumstances.  

 - Define Scope: Data sets that reveal causation.

- Famine      
- Natural Disasters (drought, flooding, soil degradation etc...)      
- Conflicts ( Military, Religious, Political etc...) 

#### Questions:      
- How much food is consumed and how do we calculate this?       
- How much food is produced domestically?        
- How much domestically produced food is exported?        
- How much food is imported? 

#### Data Set References:           
- Food Production Index        
- Agricultural Raw Materials Imports      
- Agricultural Raw Materials Exports 

#### General Remarks 			
- Normalize data for population decline and food distribution with the country along income levels.  
- Generalize metrics to cross check: donâ€™t assume a specific metric has causal relationship, discover what metrics have a causal relationship.

#### Feedback from Dr. Mohanty:
- Look into the GDP of a country with respect to mass evacuations    
- Look into Destination Countries and what metrics correlate with a high volume of Asylum seekers. 
- World Happiness Report (WH index)
- Number of countries a passport will support as a variable across countries that issue said passports 
- Merge more data sets together 
- Be able to clearly describe our data set
